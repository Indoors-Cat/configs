st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:
